# Create a Classic Pipeline with Jenkins on OpenShift 4.5

## Requirements

* An IBM Cloud account
* An OpenShift 4.x cluster with a minimum of 2 worker nodes
* Access to a terminal with the `oc` cli and `ibmcloud` cli, use [Skills Network](https://labs.cognitiveclass.ai) or [IBM Cloud shell](https://shell.cloud.ibm.com). For instructions go [here](https://ibm.github.io/workshop-setup/COGNITIVECLASS/).
* A Jenkins instance on OpenShift 4.x, see setup below,
* A Github fork of [https://github.com/remkohdev/spring-client](https://github.com/remkohdev/spring-client),
* Github personal access token

## Setup Jenkins on OpenShift 4.x

Go to [Setup Jenkins on OpenShift 4.x](https://ibm.github.io/workshop-setup/JENKINS/) to complete the Jenkins setup and configuration on OpenShift 4.x using the Jenkins Operator.

## Fork the `spring-client` App in Github

To create a fork of the spring-client repository:

1. Go to [https://github.com/remkohdev/spring-client](https://github.com/remkohdev/spring-client),
1. Cick the `Fork` button in the to right to create a fork in your own GitHub organization, e.g. `https://github.com/<username>/spring-client`
1. Review the Jenkinsfile that is included in the Spring Client repository,
1. Edit the Jenkinsfile,
1. Copy the login command to your OpenShift cluster,

    ![OpenShift Copy Login Command](../images/copy-login-command.png)

    ```console
    oc login https://c100-e.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30645 --token=CgwpwTu12sJV3u45iFFWd-6V7JsD8b90JBoJk1zGR2I
    ```

    1. In the `environment` section of the `Jenkinsfile`, change the `LOGIN_URL` and the `LOGIN_PORT` to match

    ```console
    pipeline {
    agent any
    tools { 
      maven 'maven'
    }
    environment {
        LOGIN_URL = 'https://c100-e.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com'
        LOGIN_PORT = '30645'
    }  
    ```

    **Note:** it is not proper to leave configuration details in your repository, let alone on public Github, but for simplicity I defined the URL and NodePort here.

1. Commit changes to the `Jenkinsfile` to your Github fork. The Jenkins pipeline will use your `Jenkinsfile` to deploy your forked `spring-client` to your own OpenShift cluster.

## Create a Github Personal Access Token

1. Login to your Github account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/),
1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens),
1. Click `Generate new token`,
1. Under `Note` add `github-access-token-for-jenkins-on-openshift`,
1. Select the scopes for `repo`, `read:repo_hook`, and `user`,
1. Click `Generate token`,
1. Copy the token and save it, you need it to create the Jenkins pipeline from the Github source,

    ![github personal access token 1](../images/github-personal-access-token-1.png)

    ![github personal access token 2](../images/github-personal-access-token-2.png)

1. E.g. create an environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN,

    ```console
    export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your token>
    ```

## Configure Jenkins Access to OpenShift

1. Go to the OpenShift web console again or use the `Copy Login Command` from earlier again,
1. From the logged in user profile dropdown, click the `Copy Login Command`. The command should look like,

    ```console
    oc login https://<your-openshift-url>:<your-openshift-port> --token=<your-openshift-api-token>
    ```

1. Copy the OpenShift API token value, e.g. aaHYcMwUyyusfNaS45aAiQer_Kas1YUa45YTA2AxsNI,

1. Go to the Jenkins dashboard,
1. Click Credentials, or
1. Go to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure Credentials

    ![OpenShift Jenkins credentials](../images/jenkins-credentials.png)

1. Go to Credentials > System,

    ![OpenShift Jenkins credentials](../images/jenkins-credentials-system.png)

1. In the System view, select the dropdown for Global credentials (unrestricted),

    ![OpenShift Jenkins credentials](../images/jenkins-credentials-system-add.png)

1. From the drowdown, click `Add credentials`,
1. The Jenkinsfile expects an OpenShift API token credential to be available named `openshift-login-api-token`,
1. For Kind select `Username with password`,
1. For Scope select `Global`,
1. For Username enter `token`,
1. For Password paste the OpenShift API token from the OpenShift web console login command,
1. For ID enter `openshift-login-api-token`, which is the ID that the Jenkinsfile will look for,
1. For Description enter `openshift-login-api-token`,

    ![Jenkins credentials](../images/jenkins-new-credentials.png)

1. Click OK,

    ![Jenkins new credentials](../images/jenkins-new-credential.png)

## Create a Jenkins Pipeline

1. Make sure a project `springclient-ns` exists in OpenShift,
1. if no `springclient-ns` project exists, create it from the cloud shell,

    ```console
    oc new-project springclient-ns
    ```

1. Or via the UI, open the OpenShift web console,
1. From the top navigation dropdown, go to the `Cluster Console`,
1. Go to Administration > Projects,
1. Filter projects by `springclient-ns`,
1. If there is no such project, click `Create Project` to create it,

    ![OpenShift Jenkins credentials](../images/jenkins-new-project.png)

1. The Jenkinsfile of the spring-client application defines a stage to delete and create the `springclient-ns` project. The delete step causes an error when the project it tries to delete is missing,

1. Go back to the Jenkins dashboard. If you closed Jenkins,
1. Go to the `Application Console`, and go to the project `jenkins`,
1. Click the Route for External Traffic to open the Jenkins instance,
1. Click `Log in with OpenShift`,
1. In the Jenkins Dashboard, click `Open Blue Ocean` to open the Blue Ocean editor.

    ![Jenkins Open Blue Ocean](../images/jenkins-open-blue-ocean.png)

1. If the Welcome to Jenkins popup window shows, click the `Create a new Pipeline` button,

    ![Jenkins Create new pipeline](../images/jenkins-welcome-create-pipeline.png)

1. Otherwise, click the `New Pipeline` button in the Pipelines window. This will create a new Multibranch Pipeline,

    ![Jenkins New pipeline](../images/jenkins-new-pipeline.png)

1. Select the GitHub option,

    ![Jenkins Select SCM](../images/jenkins-select-scm.png)

1. In the Connect to GitHub section, paste the personal access token you created in your Github account,

    ![Jenkins Select Organization](../images/jenkins-which-org.png)

1. Click Connect,
1. Select the organization to where you forked the `spring-client` repository,
1. Search for and select the `spring-client` repo,

    ![Jenkins Choose Repo](../images/github-token-choose-repo.png)

1. Click Create Pipeline,
1. When the pipeline creation is completed, a build is triggered automatically,

    ![Jenkins Run Pipeline](../images/jenkins-run-pipeline.png)

1. You should see a successful build of the pipeline,
1. If an error occurs, you can debug the pipeline by unfolding the red cross indicating on the stage, which indicates the pipeline failed in that stage,
1. Unfold the step in the stage, to see the log output,

    ![Jenkins Successful Build](../images/jenkins-error-1.png)

    ![Jenkins Successful Build](../images/jenkins-error-2.png)

1. Any update to the Github repository, e.g. a push to update the Jenkinsfile, source code of the Spring Boot application, or the README.md file, will automatically trigger a new build of the pipeline,

    ![Jenkins Successful Build](../images/jenkins-build-trigger.png)

1. If you're interested, review the pipeline settings:
    1. Click the Configure option,
    1. Review the settings,
1. From the cloud shell, make sure you're logged in to the OpenShift console,
1. Use the project `oc project springclient-ns`,

    ```console
    oc project springclient-ns
    ```

    outputs,

    ```console
    $ oc project springclient-ns
    Now using project "springclient-ns" on server "https://c100-e.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30645".
    ```

1. Get the route and test the deployment,

    ```console
    ROUTE="$(oc get route springclient -o json | jq -r '.spec .host')"
    curl -X GET http://$ROUTE/api/hello?name=you
    ```

    outputs,

    ```console
    ROUTE="$(oc get route springclient -o json | jq -r '.spec .host')"
    curl -X GET http://$ROUTE/api/hello?name=you
    { "message" : "Hello you" }
    ```
